Machine learning models sparking when PySpark gave the accelerator gear like the need for speed gaming cars.

## Introduction: 

Spark is the name of the engine to realize cluster computing while PySpark is the Python's library to use Spark.
PySpark is a great language for performing exploratory data analysis at scale, building machine learning pipelines, and creating ETLs for a data platform. 
If you’re already familiar with Python and libraries such as Pandas, then PySpark is a great language to learn in order to create more scalable analyses and pipelines.
